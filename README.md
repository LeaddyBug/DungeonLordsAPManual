Dungeon Lords 1.5 manual randomizer for Archipelago
This only works for classic Dungeon Lords (not steam version). And must be version 1.5 (collector's edition)
Why classic version over steam verrsion? Classic DLords has access to a game editor made by Steve2d back in 2006 and with that you can give yourself items, set classes, give skill points, and sometimes even set flags for quests.
And as for why I chose version 1.5... it added many more chests to the game and fixed some bugs (and maybe added a couple), but more accurately I chose this because it's the one I played growing up.
With that out of the way
--THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR WHEN YOU PLAY--
To access Davenmor Manor you need to talk to Emmindor with Galdryn's Horn in your possession, then take Galdryn's Horn to Talendor to put it on the altar, then go BACK and talk to Emmindor.
To access Tomb of Souls (I made it so Valdane's Blood is required, but having it without setting a trail of flags, you can't actually use it), you have to set the quest "Valkyra" as completed in the game editor.
To access the Southern Region you need Mara's Letter and Vartugg's Eye, BUT having both at the same time and talking to Vartugg... he won't open the gates to let you go south. You have to talk to him with ONLY Mara's Letter in you inventory FIRST. Then give yourself Vartugg's Eye (WITHOUT LEAVING) and talk to him again. That will make sure everything will be unlocked properly.
